	 * It gives us a little more flexibility than if we simply called json_encode()

	 *

	 * do an array_merge with the rest of the data structure, giving priority
	 * to the custom attributes. This does mean that we can use custom attributes
	 * to change the entire data structure if needed; this seems like a nice way
	 * to cover edge cases that aren't supported explicitly by the objects.
	 *
	 * Pretty much every class in this library will use this function.
	 *
	 * Note: there is a special case made here for the '$ref' property as this
	 * can be found in a lot of places, but the name of the property in the actual
	 * class can't be '$ref', so we override the key to '$ref' in the output if
	 * property is named 'ref'.
